🚗 Vehicle Price Predictor

A Machine Learning-driven web application designed to predict the resale price of used vehicles based on user-specified features such as brand, age, fuel type, and more. This project blends data preprocessing, regression modeling, and interactive UI elements using Flask.

🔍 Project Overview

This Vehicle Price Predictor leverages multiple linear regression to estimate resale values for vehicles. By analyzing trends from historical listings, the app allows users to input vehicle characteristics and receive a reliable price prediction in seconds.

📊 Features

- Interactive web interface powered by Flask 🧪  
- Cleaned and transformed dataset for model training 📉  
- Multiple Linear Regression model for prediction 🚀  
- Custom HTML and CSS styling for user-friendly design 🎨  
- Handles both numerical and categorical input features efficiently ⚙️
